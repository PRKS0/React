React is indeed JavaScript. 
We create a customReact file which give the idea of how react work. 
In React we write JSX in html format but actually bundler convert it into js(array which store in tree format)
And same like react also create a render function. but we call it in "<function/>" this function. But we can call it in function() this format also.
